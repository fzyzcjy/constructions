# A short informal report: Constructing Neural Network Parameters with Downstream Trainability

I recently conducted some preliminary experiments in my research area, AI mathematics, to have a brief test on one of my ideas. Then I realized it seems to be shifting away from AI mathematics, and further experiments need more computational power. Therefore, I may pause here. To follow the open source spirits, I write down a short informal draft report (see the PDF file), and maybe someone happens to find it a little bit useful.
